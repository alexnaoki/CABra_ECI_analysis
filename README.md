The following code is based on the [CABra's dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4070147#.X6QHwWhKiiM) and [Liu et al. (2020)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aba7e5#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20one%20in,change%20outside%20their%20topographic%20boundaries.) idea of understanding the hydrologically effective area of a catchment.

There are 4 Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, which are focus on applying the data:
- [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/alexnaoki/CABra_notebook/blob/main/pca.ipynb)
- [Random Forest](https://github.com/alexnaoki/CABra_notebook/blob/main/randomforest.ipynb)
- [Visualization of ECI x Variables](https://github.com/alexnaoki/CABra_notebook/blob/main/eci_variables_figures.ipynb)
- [Budyko Analysis](https://github.com/alexnaoki/CABra_notebook/blob/main/budyko.ipynb)
-----------------------------------
In order to run the Jupyter notebooks you will need to install at least Anaconda with Python 3.x and install the packages from the [requirements file](https://github.com/alexnaoki/CABra_notebook/blob/main/requirements.txt).
